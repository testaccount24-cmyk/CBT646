From: Lionel Dyck <Lionel.B.Dyck@KP.ORG>

Is there any tool available to convert TSO Clists to REXX?  Even
a 80-90% conversion would be a good start?

I have an applications group where the last clist programmer
retired and everyone else knows rexx and they want/need to update
their tools.

thx

I have one called CLS2REXX that I got from somewhere.  The
comments say it was written by Chuck Tribolet.  Let me know if
you want me to send it to you.

Lionel: I see other listers have provided you with Chuck
Triobolet's converter.  I have another courtesy of IBM circa
1989.   Are you interested?

Robin,

I certainly would, for comparison purposes at least.

The one I have (from IBM) is close to 4000 lines of code.  I will
attach it to an email of all listers who request it by end of
today; I am off next week.

Just a quick thought here. I got the CLIST2Rexx conversion tool,
started debugging and getting to work for my shop, then stopped.
I found that it was easier to go thru the original Clist written,
and analyze what it was doing, drop allot of dead code,
understand the business rules behind it, identify common
processes (created common called Rexx routines) and then
rewrote!!

I have talked to the author of the clist to rexx edit macro and
he will have to get his managers ok to publically share it - that
ok should come next week and once I get it I will forward it to
Sam Golob for posting on the CBT 'virtual' Tape site.

btw. the edit macro was written by Chuck over 10 years ago to
solve a problem that he had and now he is no longer involved with
mainframes (part of ibm research)

There is a version of CLS2REXX already posted to the list in a
zip file. You should be able to retrieve it by sending either:

GETPOST TSO-REXX 7786
or
GETPOST TSO-REXX 7789

to LISTSERV@VM.MARIST.EDU.

Assuming your e-mail system doesn't remove attachments.

Robin - I would be interested as it might do more or less (worth
comparing).  Do you know if it can be shared on the cbttape?

Ted is right. There seems to be a missing procedure or exec. I
honestly did not look that far into the code to notice this. I
just ran it. Does anyone who also has this code know where it is?

By the way, it is called on an OTHERWISE statement and I never
saw an error running it.
